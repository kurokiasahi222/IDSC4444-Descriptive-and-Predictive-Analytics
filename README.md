This repo contains the work I've done in 
###  IDSC4444- Descriptive and Predictive Analytics 
at the University of Minnesota.

Below is the class description.  
Descriptive and Predictive Analytics exposes students to a number of data mining and machine learning methods, including: exploratory methods (such as association rules and cluster analysis), predictive methods (such as K-NN and decision trees), and text mining methods. The course combines theoretical lectures with lab lectures, where the methods are practically implemented using the software R.
